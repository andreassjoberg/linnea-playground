# How to contribute to linnea-playground

This repo is a hobby project for an internal lottery, but is free to be used for other appropriate situations.

## Coding Standards

There are no explicit coding standards so pay attention to the general coding style, that's (mostly) used everywhere.

However, there's only one **REALLY** important rule: **use spaces for indenting** ðŸ˜‰.
